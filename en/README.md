#Introduction

Corezoid is a Cloud Process Engine, that lets You build and execute any processes and algorithms in the cloud: bots, communication scenarios, CRM functionality, client support, omni-channel marketing campaigns, hardware monitoring, anti-fraud solutions, financial management tools.  

You may think of Corezoid as a “Crazy Glue for APIs” or a metaprogramming language. It doesn’t matter which language the software you want to connect to Corezoid was created in: PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, Java, Erlang, C++, C#, etc. If your system has APIs, it can push data to Corezoid, where you can describe the logic of the whole process, orchestrating data from dozens or hundreds of APIs.
