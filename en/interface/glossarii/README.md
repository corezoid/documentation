# Glossary

**`Node`** - universal computing element with such characteristics as all the functions, semaphores, timers.

**`Queue`** - queue from objects in the node.


**`Objects`** - a set of parameters characterizing the object.

Due to certain rules, there's an object information processing is performed in the node - applying function to the object.

**`Functions`** - actions that is required to do on object from queue in node. Functions may be in the form of API, programm code, other process etc.

**`Semaphores`** - tools for logic in the node management. May be system and user.
System semaphore T - specified time of how long object can stay in the node
System semaphore N - specified amount of objects that can stay in the queue in the node.

**`Counters`** - show only value without any actions (unlike semaphores). Also may be system and user.

**`Tact`** - object transfer from one node to another
