Welcome message is sent as a reply to the received webhook which contains `"event": "conversation_started"`.

This event indicates that user came to the chat with your Public Account for the first time (it means, there's no history) or when the chat was opened through deep link.

`"conversation_started"` is not considered as subscription and does not allow the Public Account to send messages to users

But it allows to send one welcome message.


##Process description

[**Receiver**](https://admin.corezoid.com/editor/124601/207907)


Receives webhooks from Viber Public Account and distributes it depending on received value of `"event"` parameter

`"event": "message"` divides into types: picture, video, file, contact, url, location, text.

Received messages with `text` type are transferred to [**Send message**](https://admin.corezoid.com/editor/124601/207908) using [Copy task logic](https://doc.corezoid.com/en/interface/nodes/copy.html).

Successful selection of pizza or sushi and orderings are transferred to the State Diagram [**Storage orders**](https://admin.corezoid.com/editor/124601/207906) through [Modify task logic](https://doc.corezoid.com/en/interface/nodes/logika_modify_task.html) in order to receive statistic about orders.
